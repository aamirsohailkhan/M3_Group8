A Remote Keyless Entry is a type of electronic lock that regulates the entrance to a building or vehicle without a typical mechanical key. The phrase "keyless entry system" initially referred to a lock operated by a keypad positioned at or near the driver's door and needed the insertion of a predefined (or self-programmed) numeric code. These systems, which now include a concealed touch-activated keypad, are still available on some cars.
